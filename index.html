                <p class="section-content">
                    The primary purpose of this visualisation is to provide a conceptual demonstration of how a Bluetooth Mesh Network could operate in a military context. It is important to note that this is not a detailed technical simulation. All performance parameters are highly approximate and should be interpreted as such.

                <p class="section-content">
                    <strong>Created with Unity:</strong> The visualisation was developed using the <a class="link" href="https://unity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Unity</a> game engine and C#, and it has been compiled for HTML5 Web GL to ensure broad accessibility.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                    <strong>Conceptual Demonstration:</strong> The visualisation serves to illustrate the basic principles and potential applications of a Bluetooth Mesh Network in a military setting, rather than providing a precise or exhaustive simulation.
