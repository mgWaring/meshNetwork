## Visualisation of a Theoretical Bluetooth Mesh Network
# Purpose and Scope
The primary purpose of this visualisation is to provide a conceptual demonstration of how a Bluetooth Mesh Network could operate in a military context. It is important to note that this is not a detailed technical simulation. All performance parameters are highly approximate and should be interpreted as such.

# About the Visualisation
Created with Unity: The visualisation was developed using the Unity game engine and C#, and it has been compiled for HTML5 Web GL to ensure broad accessibility.

Conceptual Demonstration: The visualisation serves to illustrate the basic principles and potential applications of a Bluetooth Mesh Network in a military setting, rather than providing a precise or exhaustive simulation.

Support for Academic Research: This project supports the thesis 'The Digital Linkman' offering a visual aid to enhance understanding and engagement with the work.
